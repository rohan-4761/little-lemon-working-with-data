# Little Lemon: Working with Data in Android - Final Assignment

Welcome to the "Little Lemon: Working with Data" repository! This project serves as the final assignment for the "Working with Data in Android" course offered by Meta on Coursera. The aim of this project is to demonstrate how to work with data using Room, a SQLite database abstraction library, through a Kotlin Android application.

## Overview

"Little Lemon" showcases practical implementation of Room, an integral part of Android architecture components. Through this project, we delve into the concepts of data persistence, database design, and interaction with Room's powerful features.

## Features

- **Database Setup:** Establishes a Room database for storing data, with entities and data access objects (DAOs) defined.

- **CRUD Operations:** Demonstrates Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on data using Room's concise and efficient APIs.

- **LiveData Integration:** Utilizes LiveData to observe changes in data and automatically update the UI when data changes.

- **ViewModel Pattern:** Implements the ViewModel pattern to efficiently manage UI-related data and survive configuration changes.
